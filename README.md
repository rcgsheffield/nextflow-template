# Nextflow example

An template project structure for a research data pipeline built using the [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/) workflow management system and organised following the [nf-core guidelines](https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/pipelines/pipeline_file_structure). It provides a structured approach to developing reproducible and scalable bioinformatics pipelines.

# Installation

Please read the [Nextflow installation instructions](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html) to install Java and Nextflow.

It's recommended to [set up your development environment](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/developer-env.html) also.

# Usage

To run the Nextflow workflow, use the following command:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf
```

Make sure to adjust any parameters in the configuration files as needed for your specific use case.
